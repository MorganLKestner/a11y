Accessibility Program Resources

## What is this?

This project has tools to help teams manage their accessibility work. Right now, it includes a system called "Direct First Responder" (DFR).

## What does it do?

The DFR Support Wheel helps teams:
- Track who is responsible for tasks each day
- Share schedules with the whole team
- Update calendars automatically when things change

## What's included?

- **Template spreadsheet**: A Google Sheets template to track your schedule
- **Calendar script**: Code that connects your spreadsheet to Google Calendar
- **Setup guide**: Step-by-step instructions to get everything working

## Getting started

Check out the `direct-first-responder` folder for the template and instructions.
